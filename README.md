# Qt Car Workshop Manager

## ðŸš— Overview

This repository contains two Qt-based applications that work together:

### ðŸ›  QtCarWorkshopManager
An application that simulates a **single automotive workshop**:
- Generates a random workshop location (city + address) on startup.
- Dynamically generate clients' cars and repair issues
- Dynamically adds and updates cars in a scrollable UI.
- View and fix car issues
- Scrollable client list with real-time interaction
- Tracks total revenue (`takings`) and types of issues fixed.
- Sends current workshop state over TCP after each repair.
- Creates simple reports in PDF about all repairs

### ðŸ“Š QtMultipleWorkshopsManager
A second application that acts as a **central monitor** for multiple workshops:
- Runs a TCP server and listens for incoming workshop data.
- Parses received messages with `city`, `address`, `takings`, and issues.
- Dynamically adds or updates workshop widgets in a scrollable UI.
- Visually displays each workshop's location, income, and repair history (e.g. `3x Dead Battery â€“ 1200 $`).

### ðŸ”Œ Communication
Data is exchanged in a simple TCP format:
city=Krakow
address=Szeroka 184
takings=3160
issue=Loose tie rod:1400
issue=Dead battery:400
